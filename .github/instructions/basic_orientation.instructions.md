This project is supposed to create a prototype for a general Police Management System using Python. It should be as modular and lightweight as possible. The amount of data that will need to be read and written at the same time to manage a large city could be immense so provisions should be made to make the performance really good. The release version of the software will certainly be in another programming language, so there isn't much need to focus on optimizing code for Python specifically, but to follow best practices for computer science in general. This prototype will need a GUI, so I will need for all modules to work with a GUI but there is no need to focus on design choices as long as the functionality is as I want.
